**Project Title:** Validation of new Interoception Questionnaire

**Project Description**

The present study is a online survey with the aim of validating a new Intercoption Questionnaire, by looking at its factor structure. The survey will contain the following parts:

1. Study information and consent form.
2. Standard demographic questions (age, gender, educational level)
3. Instructions page followed by the Intercoption questionnaire which contains 92 items.
4. Wearables questionnaire containing 17 items.
5. Feedback and Debriefing information.

Consent form

At the beginning, participants will be shown information about the study's goal (no deception will be involved). 
The page also emphasizes that their response and participation will be kept confidential and entirely anonymous (no IP addresses are collected). 
Participant's data is saved only at the end of the study (giving them a chance to retract their participation till the end). 

Demographic information

Participant will then answer a few demographic questions designed to better
identify the characteristics and representativeness of the sample (age, sex, education level, ethnicity, country of current residence). No IP
addresses will be collected, and the deanonymized data with identifiers, will be stored on a University Box only accessible to the researchers.

Questionnaires

Participants will be informed that the study aims to develop a new Interoception questionnaire and that it includes attention-check items. They will be advised that failing these checks may result in withholding their rewards (e.g., credits or payment). Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) items organized by modalities (e.g., heart, gastric); (2) items organized by dimensions (e.g., accuracy, negative arousal â€“ anxious); or (3) items presented in a randomized order. After completing the questionnaire, participants will be asked to rate their usage of wearable devices (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Watch).

Feedback & Debriefing

Participants will be asked if they enjoyed the survey and whether they have any thoughts they want to share. Lastly, a debriefing screen will appear with the aim of the survey explicit (e.g., validation of a new questionnaire) and more information regarding Interoception is given alongside a reminder that data is anonymised. 

Participants

Participants will be recruited via convenience sampling (e.g., via social media), or via other recruitment platforms if available (e.g., SONA, Prolific). 
The samples from different methods of recruitment will be collected separately in case they are different (the incentive type - e.g., student credits - and amount - or lack thereof - will thus be known to mitigate its potential effect).As we aim at recruiting a diverse sample, there are no exclusion criteria.

Risks

There are no risks involved in this study.

**Section A**

No.
A6: Yes. 
A10. Participants will be asked to report on their race, gender, age, educational level, ethcniticty, and the country of current residence. However, all the data will be anonymised and their participation will be kept confidential (ie., no recording of IP address). 

**Section B**

- B.1: Study will attempt to recruit a minimum of 300 participants (based on typical samples of similar studies), with no exclusion criteria.
- B.2: Participants will be recruited via recruitment platforms (e.g., SONA, Prolific). The samples from different methods of recruitment will be collected 
separately in case they are different (the incentive type - e.g., student credits - and amount - or lack thereof - will thus be known to mitigate its potential effect).
- B.3: Online survey
- B.5: The survey will be completed online.
- B.5: No
- B.6: Yes
- B.7: Yes
- B.8: N/A
- B.9: Yes
- B.10: Yes
- B.11: Yes
    B11a: Survey is anonymous so name will not be collected. Deanonimized data is stored privately on university Box.
- B.12: No
    B12a: Potential for anonymous data sharing is included in the consent.
- B.13: Yes
- B.14: N/A
- B.15: Yes
- B.16: Yes
- B.17: Participants will be asked to click a box informing consent for the study.
- B.18: No
