**Project Title**: Validation of the MINT Questionnaire [Amendment]

**Project Description**:

<!-- Study 2 Ethics Amendment  -->

We propose running the same experiment as in the previously approved project (ER/MB2021/2), with minor modifications.

Specifically, all participants recruited through SONA will now be automatically accredited; however, we are introducing a random allocation mechanism that assigns participants to one of two conditions:

    - Attention Checks Condition – Participants will be informed in the consent form (see consent document) that their course credit depends on passing attention checks throughout the experiment.
    - Quiz Condition – Participants will be informed that their course credit depends on correctly answering three multiple-choice questions about the experiment at the end (see quiz document).

The purpose of these modifications is to assess which approach yields higher data quality in an online setting. We will compare the two conditions based on the proportion of failed attention checks to determine which method is more effective in ensuring participant attentiveness.

<!-- Study 2 Aproved Ethics -->

The present study is a online survey with the aim of validating a new interoceptive questionnaire, by looking at its correlations with other interoceptive scales, traits and disorders. The survey will contain the following parts:

1. Study information and consent form.
2. Standard demographic questions (age, gender, educational level).
3. 12 Questionnaires (MINT; 3 Interoception questionnaires; 4 Trait questionnaires and 4 disorder questionnaires).
4. Physical exercise and wearables questions.
5. Feedback and Debriefing information.

Consent form

At the beginning, participants will be shown information about the study's goal (no deception will be involved).
The page also emphasizes that their response and participation will be kept confidential and entirely anonymous (no IP addresses are collected).
Participant's data is saved only at the end of the study (giving them a chance to retract their participation till the end).

Demographic information

Participant will then answer a few demographic questions designed to better identify the characteristics and representativeness of the sample (age, sex, education level, ethnicity, country of current residence). No IP addresses will be collected, and the deanonymized data with identifiers, will be stored on a University Box only accessible to the researchers.

Questionnaires

Participants will be informed that the study aims to validate a new Interoception questionnaire and that it includes attention-check items. They will be advised that failing these checks may result in withholding their rewards (e.g., credits or payment).

    * Interoception questionnaires: MAIA-2 (Mehling et al., 2018); IAS (Murphy et al., 2020) ; BPQ-VSF (Brand et al., 2024)
    * Trait questionnaires: TAS20 (Bagby et al., 1994) ; CERQ (Saetren et al., 2025), B-ERS (Veilleux et al., 2024), and  PI18 (Clifton, 2019)
    * Disorders: PHQ4 (Kroenke et al., 2009) + life satisfaction question; CEFSA-S (Cernis et al., 2024), Mental Health, and  Psychosomatic Disorders.

The sequence always begins with the MINT questionnaire, followed by a trait questionnaire-disorder questionnaire or disorder-trait pairing. Subsequent rounds consist of one interoception questionnaire followed by a trait-disorder or disorder-trait pairing. All questionnaires, except the MINT, are randomised within their categories.

Feedback & Debriefing

Participants will be asked if they enjoyed the survey and whether they have any thoughts they want to share. Lastly, a debriefing screen will appear with the aim of the survey explicit (e.g., validation of a new questionnaire) and more information regarding Interoception is given alongside a reminder that data is anonymised.

Participants

Participants will be recruited via convenience sampling (e.g., via social media), or via other recruitment platforms if available (e.g., SONA, Prolific).
The samples from different methods of recruitment will be collected separately in case they are different (the incentive type - e.g., student credits - and amount - or lack thereof - will thus be known to mitigate its potential effect).As we aim at recruiting a diverse sample, there are no exclusion criteria.

Risks

There are no risks involved in this study.

**Section A**

No.
A6: Yes.
A10. Participants will be asked to report on their race, gender, age, educational level, ethnicity, and the country of current residence. However, all the data will be anonymised and their participation will be kept confidential (ie., no recording of IP address).

**Section B**

-   B.1: Study will attempt to recruit a minimum of 300 participants (based on typical samples of similar studies), with no exclusion criteria.
-   B.2: Participants will be recruited via recruitment platforms (e.g., SONA, Prolific). The samples from different methods of recruitment will be collected
    separately in case they are different (the incentive type - e.g., student credits - and amount - or lack thereof - will thus be known to mitigate its potential effect).
-   B.3: Online survey
-   B.4: The survey will be completed online.
